# Ubuntu 16.04 build notes:

Some dependencies were installed when I installed Gqrx, so some libraries might be missing if you do not already have SDR software installed. To install Gqrx: `sudo apt install gqrx-sdr`.

```
sudo apt install cmake

sudo apt install build-essential

sudo apt install libitpp-dev

sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapack-dev

sudo apt install libfftw3-dev

sudo apt install librtlsdr-dev

sudo apt install libncurses-dev
```

LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker
--------------------------

This is a collection of tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using
very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832
based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8
bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 ppm.

The 'CellSearch' program can be used to search for LTE carriers within a range
of frequencies.  Once an LTE frequency has been located, 'LTE-Tracker' can be
used to monitor and track, in realtime, any LTE cells on that frequency.

The main documentation in html format can be found on the web at:
  http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools
And in the doc/index.html subdirectory of this distribution.
